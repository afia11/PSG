Pay Slip Generation
Pay Slip Generation System (PSG) is a C++-based console application designed to help small organizations or HR departments manage employee salary details efficiently. This system takes employee information like ID, name, basic salary, and overtime hours, and automatically calculates the salary components such as DA (Dearness Allowance), HRA (House Rent Allowance), Medical Allowance, and Overtime Pay. It then generates a professional and detailed Pay Slip for each employee.
